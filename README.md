# Course Management
Course Management System Software is an online management system built in Java using Spring Boot. The main purpose of this is to make efficient interaction between students and instructors attending a educational institution.

One of the major goals of this was to recreate a project in which I developed for a previous employer. Updating for current times but still operating much as it would have.
